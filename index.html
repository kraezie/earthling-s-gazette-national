            Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) just recently became a law in the Philippines. One of its mechanism is the Deposit Return System (DRS) which is a project implemented in various countries such as Norway to ensure a sustainable and better plastic waste management.
            <br>
            <br>
            "EPR is essentially putting the responsibility on producers relying on the polluter based principle to essentially put the responsibility on them for collection and end of life management," said TOMRAH Head of Public Affairs, Asia Anupa Ahi. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Since we are only buying the content, this law mandates all individuals to put deposit on the packaging of products we are purchasing such as beverage containers. Once returned, the deposit you initially give will be returned as well. This concept ensures a circular process of the material.
            <br>
            <br>
            When asked about the amount of deposit, "In different countries, we have different deposit values. It should be high enough to motivate people to return it, and it should not be that high that it attracts fraud. And not that low that it's not incentivizing," Anupa responded.
            <br>
            <br>
            EPR is perceived to be beneficial in reducing carbon emission in the country. Such deposit systems are impactful in addressing 30 to 35% of marine litters.
            <br>
            <br>
            Royal Norwegian Embassy in Manila Ambassador Chritian Lyster, on the other hand, claimed that EPS and DRS have been successful in his country. 
            <br>
            <br>
            "I must say I grew up with the system I've been taught from. I was a little kid that we return our bottles, we return our cans and in 2021 the return rate in Norway was 92.3%," uttered Ambassador Lyster.
            <br>
            <br>
            Despite the population difference, Lyter perceived this to work well in the Philippines because of the mentality of Filipinos in taking care of the materials and ensuring that these materials will get a new life. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Anupa, moreover, believes that through proper implementation of the law, this system can be promoted, thus, achieving ambitious environmental goals.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Philippines, according to Ambassador Lyster, have put the EPR Law in place. However, a feasibility study must be conducted to make sure that the policy is effective in the Philippines.
